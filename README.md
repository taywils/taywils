## 👋 Hello World

  - Mobile Development (iOS, Swift)
  - Full-Stack Web Development (Ruby on Rails, React) 

### 💻 Currently Working On 🛠️

> As of 2025 I'm primarily focused on Full-Stack Rails taking advantage of all the great new features of Rails 8

### 🏗️ Things I'm Watching 🔭

- Crypto, Bitcoin, and the potential for Digital Currencies as an alternative to traditional investments
- Stocks, Options and Financial Markets/Fintech
- Using Sqlite in production...
- HTMX and HATEOAS--the ability to wean off heavy client-side rendering and the resurgence of SSR (its cool again)
