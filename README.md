## 👋 Hello World

- Thank you for checking out my Github page.
- Here you'll find examples of code I've written; feel free to clone, fork, or simply browse any of my public repositories.

### 📒 About Me

- I've worked across many areas of software development including...
  - Backend PHP E-commerce (Magento, Yii, Lithium)
  - Mobile Development (iOS, Swift)
  - Full-Stack Web Development (Ruby on Rails, React) 

### 💻 Currently Working On 🛠️

> As of 2025 I'm primarily focused on Full-Stack Rails taking advantage of all the great new features of Rails 8

- [purelinks.xyz](https://purelinks.xyz) **A minimalist Link Sharing and Questionnaires site**
- **Unamed Project** I've been thinking about a way to use AI Agents to interact with your "stuff"
  - "Stuff" as in things you own or want to own
  - Its not going to be some spreadsheet/barcode/warehouse thing but imagine if you could "talk to your belongings"

### 🏗️ Things I'm Watching 🔭

- LLMs, Generative AI and all things related to immersive AI Agents (purely virtual influencers)
- Crypto, Bitcoin, and the potential for Digital Currencies as an alternative to traditional investments
- Stocks, Options and Financial Markets/Fintech
- Using Sqlite in production...
- HTMX and HATEOAS--the ability to wean off heavy client-side rendering and the resurgence of SSR (its cool again)
